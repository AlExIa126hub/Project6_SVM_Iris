# Project6_SVM_Iris
This project aims to build a SVM model for binary classification on the Iris dataset.
Specifications:
* different kernel types (linear, polynomial, RBF) were used
* decision boundaries were visualised
○ results were interpreted:
■ the results achieved by the classifier on the test data
■ the efficiency of each kernel type for this task
